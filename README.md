EasyCryptoJS
============

This is just a simple javascript crypto library that uses the new Web Crypto API. This is started out with me just wanted to learn about this API, but I found that I couldn't find a nice working example anywhere online. Currently, only IE 11 on Windows 8.1 has working implementation, but their documenation doesn't seem to work. 

So I ended up hacking until I figured out, and I figured otherse would have the same issues as me. So this can be a working example for others. 

### TODO
    -   Clean up API to pass in onerror, oncomplete, onprogress handlers
    -   update to prosimes interface (IE's implementation doesn't do that yet)
